You can Google search for numbers. 

Some of the larger ones will return no results.

The question is: what is the smallest number that doesn't return any Google result?

## Ground rules

First we need to establish some ground rules.

1. We will only consider *positive* numbers. [1]
2. We will only consider *integers* (not floating point numbers).
3. We will only consider numbers written in arabic numerals. So no English words, no Roman numerals, etc.

## Is there a smallest ungoogleable number?

**Yes, and there always will be.** 

There is an infinite number of integers, but only a finite number of bits encodable on the Internet [2]. 
The [Pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) will show that there will always be a number that isn't encoded on the Internet, and thus will not be Googleable.

## So what is the smallest ungoogleable number?
<insert number here>

This is true as of <insert date here>. This will likely cease to be the smallest ungoogleable number once this post gets picked up by Google, and appears as a result.

Unless I continually update this post, but who's got time for that? ðŸ¤”


[1] If we allow negative numbers, we can flip the question and ask "what is the smallest Googleable number?". But this is my blog, and I get to make the rules.
[2] The number of bits encodable by the Internet is a massive number, and is one that is - at this point in history - growing over time, but it is still finite. It will be limited by the [number of bits in the observable universe](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/35920/maximum-possible-information-in-the-universe).
